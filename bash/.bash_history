Hello
Just checking in as I have not received a reply to my email of a week ago, so I am now not just concerned but frustrated as well. I have no idea whether the messages I received bare any truth at all.
As I said in my previous message, I do understand that you may not be able to give me any details but I would be immensely grateful for some kind of reply.
